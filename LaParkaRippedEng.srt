1
00:01:33,864 --> 00:01:40,454
The Reaper

2
00:06:10,460 --> 00:06:12,684
The first day I began working...

3
00:06:12,684 --> 00:06:14,700
...at the slaughterhouse,

4
00:06:17,231 --> 00:06:20,720
That night I was dreaming
that I was here...

5
00:06:20,750 --> 00:06:22,500
...in the slaughterhouse.

6
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:26,960
The animals came in and they
starred at me...

7
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:30,590
saying "what's up? now it's your turn".

8
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:36,850
Meaning that they were looking at me
like if I was an animal.

9
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:44,258
Those are dreams that one has.

10
00:06:45,175 --> 00:06:48,053
But they most be for some reason.

11
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:13,662
When I arrived to the slaughterhouse,
I labeled my boots "the Pinocchio"...

12
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,373
...and then came one of my
coworkers and said...

13
00:07:16,390 --> 00:07:19,334
..."no, you are going to be the reaper",

14
00:07:19,350 --> 00:07:21,879
from then they started calling me
the reaper... reaper,

15
00:07:21,879 --> 00:07:24,715
that's how it stayed, for murderer.

16
00:09:05,620 --> 00:09:08,590
I am afraid of death.

17
00:09:09,470 --> 00:09:12,781
Yes, because one goes to work, right?...

18
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:15,826
but you don't know if you are
going to come back home.

19
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:20,310
...and when its your turn to
died, you just died.

20
00:09:22,780 --> 00:09:25,770
It's because one's stayed
there, in the street.

21
00:09:27,270 --> 00:09:31,280
Its when life its over and the reaper
came to take you to death.

22
00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:44,950
It's like going around the world.

23
00:09:47,500 --> 00:09:50,080
Because when we died
this world is over,

24
00:09:50,080 --> 00:09:52,210
you don't see it ever again.

25
00:09:52,930 --> 00:09:57,510
People say in this world,
there is glory and hell.

26
00:09:58,740 --> 00:10:00,912
For me, that is a lie.

27
00:10:01,010 --> 00:10:04,958
When I die, my world it's over.

28
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:09,129
Hell is what I live here.

29
00:10:30,790 --> 00:10:34,500
At the top I can be stronger but
being down in the cage...

30
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,710
...they're stronger than you.

31
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:39,010
Because they're in the little box,

32
00:10:39,010 --> 00:10:40,720
I mean, they're shut in there.

33
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:43,550
In the little box, you can
kill them.

34
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:46,480
And you can be stronger.
At the top yes,

35
00:10:47,100 --> 00:10:49,560
but when you're down
not anymore.

36
00:10:50,070 --> 00:10:53,520
Down there in the cage the
animal is stronger than you.

37
00:12:06,690 --> 00:12:10,180
I lived my father's loss,

38
00:12:11,400 --> 00:12:14,810
like the word looked very
small to me.

39
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:20,070
I went walking through the street,

40
00:12:20,330 --> 00:12:21,990
thinking only about him.

41
00:12:23,330 --> 00:12:28,120
Little by little I started
getting rid of that idea,

42
00:12:28,590 --> 00:12:30,562
when I started seeing my children,

43
00:12:30,580 --> 00:12:32,355
I am going to take care them...

44
00:12:32,370 --> 00:12:35,390
...because my father now is resting,
and my childrens?...

45
00:12:35,420 --> 00:12:37,090
...they're going to stay suffering,

46
00:12:37,130 --> 00:12:40,906
I could get sick any moment and
then, it's all over.

47
00:13:35,530 --> 00:13:36,890
I think everyone can kill,

48
00:13:36,890 --> 00:13:38,310
having the experience.

49
00:13:39,940 --> 00:13:43,552
The only thing is getting the experience,
and then everyone can kill.

50
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:45,900
Like me that I already know.

51
00:13:46,805 --> 00:13:49,099
It has been 20 years, 30 years.

52
00:13:49,099 --> 00:13:54,062
For a beginner which only has two years,
the bull's going to escape.

53
00:15:16,580 --> 00:15:18,146
When my sister died,

54
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:21,380
I felt bad when I killed the bulls..

55
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:23,777
...because one sees the animals,

56
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:26,863
and then figures that one
is going to end like that,

57
00:15:28,170 --> 00:15:29,866
Like an animal.

58
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:32,260
Because an animal feels like you do.

59
00:15:32,890 --> 00:15:34,970
Even if you are hitting it
and hitting it,

60
00:15:35,610 --> 00:15:37,810
feels just like you do.

61
00:15:38,190 --> 00:15:39,890
When I kill the bulls,

62
00:15:39,890 --> 00:15:42,140
they cry,

63
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:43,810
and they get a tear on their eyes.

64
00:15:43,990 --> 00:15:46,675
I mean, you kill a bull
and they get tears.

65
00:15:47,926 --> 00:15:50,553
l think a person is the same...

66
00:15:50,553 --> 00:15:54,474
...and its pain that is not endured
by bulls or any other animals.

67
00:17:12,761 --> 00:17:14,846
The first time I came to the slaughterhouse...

68
00:17:16,097 --> 00:17:17,932
...I was coming from my house,

69
00:17:17,932 --> 00:17:21,978
I passed by the slaughterhouse
and I saw a sign...

70
00:17:21,978 --> 00:17:25,148
...that said that they needed workers...

71
00:17:25,148 --> 00:17:29,444
so I asked for a job and they
say yes, come tomorrow...

72
00:17:29,444 --> 00:17:31,654
...and I got the job.

73
00:17:31,654 --> 00:17:34,908
I started here sweeping the corrals,

74
00:17:36,951 --> 00:17:41,956
and then I got interested on
how they killed the bulls.

75
00:17:42,874 --> 00:17:48,838
So I asked them if they borrowed
me the knife and I killed one.

76
00:17:48,838 --> 00:17:53,426
Since then I liked to kill bulls.

77
00:20:26,329 --> 00:20:29,082
My family thinks that my job is dangerous,

78
00:20:29,082 --> 00:20:32,085
that's why they tell me to quick my job.

79
00:20:32,085 --> 00:20:35,421
With this job l have been hurt,

80
00:20:35,421 --> 00:20:37,423
because of what happens there...

81
00:20:37,423 --> 00:20:40,426
...they're accidents and it is dangerous,

82
00:20:40,426 --> 00:20:44,030
that's why my family its
always taking care of me.

83
00:26:05,918 --> 00:26:08,879
I would never kill a human being...

84
00:26:10,923 --> 00:26:14,552
...because it's not an animal,

85
00:26:16,304 --> 00:26:18,070
it's not a bull.

86
00:26:18,723 --> 00:26:22,518
I mean, the bulls l kill its
because of the economic need.

87
00:26:23,394 --> 00:26:27,523
Yes, because if I do not kill,
then I and my family don't eat.

88
00:27:28,709 --> 00:27:33,506
Efrain, kills every day between
500 hundreds bulls,

89
00:27:33,506 --> 00:27:37,385
6 days a week, since 25 years ago.
